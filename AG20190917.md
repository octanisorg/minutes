### 4. Financial result and balance of 2018/19 and report on our activities

Quentin presents the financial results of last year. The sales of goods and services may decrease in volume next year due to the creation of Octanis Instruments taking care of the commercial projects.

Presenting the new budget (see slides): Lower sponsoring amount and big project amount expected and therefore a lower overall budget.
