#### 1. Financial result and balance of 2015/16 and report on our activities

Quentin summarizes the accounting as stated on the presentation. The current balance including bank account, paypal account and cashbox sums up to 992.70 CHF, which have resulted from 2680.90 in revenues and 1688.20 in expenses. The revenues consist of to fifths of membership fees, the same amount from sponsoring and donations and one fifth from workshop tickets On the expenses side, a third went into lab material and events, another third into logistics for the rover and the balloon launch and a third into workshop expenses, which also contain already a future balloon event / workshop.

The project expenses are by default not paid for by the association, but by the individual members. The goal hereby is not to limit the membeers, but rather to make them more creative and find innovative, more low-cost solutions to their problems. 
Those expenses made for Constellatin Rover are entirely covered for by the directly associated sponsoring amount.

Looking in the future, we will try to increase revenues from workshops. As we can pay for material with the workshop fees, excess materials can then be used "for free" for different projects as well. We will also continue looking for sponsors as we did for the rover, and multiple other funding sources.

#### 2. Activity report

Marion recounts the events of last year, including:

 * Elargis tes Horizons (Scientific workshops for girls around the age of 14)
 * STIL (Technology and innovation exhibition in Lausanne; brought us many new members)
 * Balloon Launch 
 * Salon SV (Exhibition in the Life Science department at EPFL)
 * Summer work for the Constellation Rover (in total 17 contributors)

Samir mentions that the rover has been sent this summer and is currently on the ship from Tasmania to Antarctica.

Starting this summer, we are organising workshops ( 1 day ) and courses ( 1h ). Samir debriefs the raspberry Pi workshop, where we got 5-star-rating and very positive feedback in general: The participants liked it and want more events like this. Smaller courses that have been given were the oscilloscope and the design thinking courses. Also there we received good feedback: One participant even wanted us to carry out the design thinking course at their company.

There are at the moment 3 scheduled workshops in the future: Pipetting course, Bacterial Streaking workshop and PCB design workshop, all happening in November.


#### 3. Discharge of the committee

The executive committee has been discharged and the financial result has been approved by all present members.

#### 4. Election of the Executive Committee

The following members of the committee have been elected to continue in their role inside the board by all present members:
  * Samir Sulaimanov (President)
  * Raffael Tschui (Vice-President)
  * Quentin Cabrol (Treasurer)
  * Marion Curdy (Communication/Events)

All present members have also elected Ana Roldan to join the committee to complement the Communication/Events activities. 

#### 5. Exclusion of Members

It has been decided to exclude the member Mick, due to non-responsiveness and non-payment of membership fees during one year. 

#### 6. Change of articles

Due to the upcoming general change of our articles resulting form the EPFL recognition process, Raffael already proposes to change the articles concerning the membership types and membership fees, in order to have a continuous bookkeeping for this year. EPFL requests among others to ask to have a yearly membership fee billing as well as to reduce the difference between committee and non-committee member fees. Due to no real demand, the differenciation between Starter and Resident member can be dropped. The following articles are therefore proposed to be changed:

 * Current Art. 6 - Membership Duration:

"Memberships are automatically renewed every half year"

 * New Art. 6 - Membership Duration:

"Memberships are automatically renewed every year"

 * Current Art. 8 - Membership Types:
            
"The association makes a distinction between «Resident» and «Starter» members. Junior members have access to the associations facilities but may not use any materials, goods or tools of the association.
                    
Full members have access to the full workshop of the association and are allowed to use 3D printing, manual/reflow soldering, parts, materials and various other tools to create their prototypes."

 * New Art. 8 - Membership Benefits:
                    
"Members have access to the full workshop of the association and are allowed to use 3D printing, manual/reflow soldering, parts, materials and various other tools to create their prototypes."

 * Current Art. 9 - Membership Fees:

"(a) “Starter” Member: 7.- / half year
(b) “Resident” Member: 20.- / half year
(c) Executive Committee Member: 100.- / half year"

 * New Art. 9 - Membership Fees:

"(a) Member outside Committee: 50.- / year
(b) Executive Committee Member: 100.- / year"

 * Current Art. 10 - Voting Rights:
            
"«Starter», «Resident» and Executive Committee members have equal voting rights. Passive members have no voting rights."

 * New Art. 10 - Voting Rights:

"Members outside the committee and Executive Committee members have equal voting rights. Passive members have no voting rights."

The present members voted unanimously for all the propsed changes of articles.


#### 6. Misc

Samir mentions the almost completet EPFL acknowledgement process. We are only waiting for the final approved version of our statutes. Once the process is completed, we plan to increase our presence on the campus, for example by making use of unused spaces on campus - for example in the corridors in front of labs. "Le village"-people may develop some concepts (for example installation of microwave ovens, recreation spaces, project exhibitions, etc).

Concerning the octanis.org website, Samir envisions some changes as we are redefining ourselves as an association. We will therefore in the coming weeks change some texts on the site and provide more visibility to our smaller projects, e.g. in the form of an "Archives" page. Another goal is also to push name "Constellation" for the rover.

Something that has been added already is the members area octanis.org/intranet, which contains forms for reimboursements of expenses, a workshop submission form and other important information.

Quentin suggests that we give some feedback to the French senator who connected us with the researchers from Grenoble. It was agreed that we will do so once we have some results from the field mission.

The laser-cut wood model for Le village has been disposed of, since it was taking away space for more active projects. This will be general practice for all the projects that have been inactive for too much time.


#### Closing

The General Assembly is closed at 19:15 .
